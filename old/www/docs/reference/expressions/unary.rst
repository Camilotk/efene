Unary Expression
----------------

::

        op Expr

Unary expressions are operators that apply on one expression.

The operators are:

====     ===============
op       Description
====     ===============
`+`      
`-`      unary negation
`~`      binary negation
not      boolean not
====     ===============

the + operator doesn't affect the expression.

Examples::

        >>> +2
        2
        >>> -2
        -2
        >>> ~2
        -3
        >>> not true
        false
